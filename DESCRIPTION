Description: Several functions are provided to:
  1) estimate differential Shannon entropy i.e., estimate Shannon entropy of real random variables whose distribution is dominated by the Lebesgue measure;
  2) test the goodness-of-fit of a vector of real numbers (a sample) to some Maximum Entropy distributions, including uniform, Gaussian, log-normal, exponential, Gamma, Weibull, Pareto, Fisher, Laplace and beta distributions.
